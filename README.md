# Some plugins for RPG Maker MV

This is a small collection of plugins made for RPG Maker MV.  
Feel free to use any of them and to credit me (pretty please).

### Items Fine Targeting

Can define precisely on which Actors/Enemies specific Items can be used.

### Pixel Perfection

Make sure every image is loaded with `SCALE_MODE.NEAREST` in Pixi and set the the canvas image-rendering property to 'pixelated'.
